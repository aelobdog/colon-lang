            Bru is an HDL based electronics simulator. It stitches together HDL
            files and input(script) files to produce a Go program, which when
            run, outputs the results of the simulation.

            Dynar is a C preprocessor of sorts that lets you use dynamic arrays
            as if they were an inbuilt datatype in C. It lets you create
            resizable arrays and provides functions to push, pop, insert and
            delete elements in/belonging to the array.
